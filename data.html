    <h2>About The Birds</h2>

    <p>                   Birds are very special animals that have particular characteristics which are common amongst all of them.
        For instance, all of them have feathers, wings and two legs. Similarly, all birds lay eggs and are warm-blooded.
        They are very essential for our environment and exist in different breeds.We have always admired the birds. They
        have wings and can fly unlike us. Of course, this applies if you forget the modern inventions. However, their
        freedom and power to soar high in the clouds is an unfulfilled wish of many people.</p>
